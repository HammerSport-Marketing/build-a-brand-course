## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

Not another ecom frame work right?
<h3 align="center">Hold on</h3>
<p>This framework you might just want to use. </p>
<p>It took a long time to find a solution that worked for me as well it does for other people.</p>
<p>The architecture of this project is what makes it unique.</p>
<p>Uses SQLite for effeciencey sake but because the backend is written in StrapiJS, it can be readily converted to any other database of your choosing.</p>
<h5>This framework is everything you need to start selling your product today.</h5>
